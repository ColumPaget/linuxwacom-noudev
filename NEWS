2.6 kernels older than 2.6.8 are removed from the project to avoid updating 
the less used kernels. Support for X.Org 7 is added.

We managed to merge x86 and x86-64 back into one package now (release 0.7.1). 
The package contents have been changed too (no need to build mousedev and 
usbmouse and change /dev/input/mice in X configure file xorg.conf or XF86Config 
for 2.6.x anymore). Refer to ChangeLog and website for details.
