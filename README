Most end users would probably only need to update the Wacom X driver and the /etc/X11/xorg.conf file to use the rich features that Wacom tablets offer. The steps could be as simple as:

download the package then
    $ bunzip2 linuxwacom.tar.bz2
    $ tar xvf linuxwacom.tar
    $ cd linuxwacom/prebuilt
    $ su
    # ./uninstall
    # ./install
    # cp /etc/X11/xorg.conf /etc/X11/xorg.conf.bak
    # gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf
    # reboot

==============================================================================

However, if you have a USB tablet which is newer than your running kernel, i.e., the tablet is not supported by your running kernel, or you are a developer who is willing to build the driver from the source, there are extra work waiting for you.

==============================================================================

BUILDING FROM TARBALL:

As you would expect, run configure and make.  Configure options are explained below.

    $ ./configure && make

==============================================================================

CONFIGURE OPTIONS:

This file contains hints for building the sources.  There are a number of
build targets, some of which are not built automatically.  Here is the
breakdown:

      wacom.o: not built by default (--enable-wacom, --disable-wacom)
      wacdump: built by default (--enable-wacdump, --disable-wacdump)
        hid.o: not built by default (--enable-hid, --disable-hid)
      evdev.o: not built by default (--enable-evdev, --disable-evdev for kernel 2.4.x only)
   mousedev.o: not built by default (--enable-mousedev, --disable-mousedev. It is used for kernel 2.4.x only)
   usbmouse.o: not built by default (--enable-usbmouse, --disable-usbmouse. It is used  for kernel 2.4.x only)
      input.o: not built by default (--enable-input, --disable-input. It is used  for kernel 2.4.x only)
  wacom_drv.o: built by default (--enable-wacomdrv, --disable-wacomdrv)

There are many options, and configure will attempt to guess the correct
values for most of them.  By default, only wacomcpl, xsetwacom,  wacom_drv.o, 
xidump, and wacdump program are built.

Please surf the HOWTO page at http://linuxwacom.sf.net/index.php/howto/main to find the proper options if the default building environment doesn't work for you.
