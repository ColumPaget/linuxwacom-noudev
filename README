Most end users would probably only need to update the Wacom X driver and the 
/etc/X11/xorg.conf file to use the rich features that Wacom tablets offer. 
The steps could be as simple as:

download the package then
    $ bunzip2 linuxwacom.tar.bz2
    $ tar xvf linuxwacom.tar
    $ cd linuxwacom/prebuilt
    $ su
    # yum remove linuxwacom
    # ./uninstall
    # ./install
    # cp /etc/X11/xorg.conf /etc/X11/xorg.conf.bak
    # gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf
    # reboot

==============================================================================

However, if you have a USB tablet which is newer than your running kernel, i.e., 
the tablet is not supported by your running kernel, or you are a developer who is 
willing to build the driver from the source, there are extra work waiting for you.

==============================================================================

BUILDING FROM TARBALL:

As you would expect, run configure and make.  Configure options are explained below.

    $ ./configure && make

==============================================================================

CONFIGURE OPTIONS:

This file contains hints for building the sources.  There are a number of build
 targets, some of which are not built automatically.  Here is the
breakdown:

      wacom.o: not built by default (--enable-wacom, --disable-wacom)
      wacdump: built by default (--enable-wacdump, --disable-wacdump)
       xidump: built by default (--enable-xidump, --disable-xidump)
    xsetwacom: built by default (--enable-xsetwacom, --disable-xsetwacom)
        hid.o: not built by default (--enable-hid, --disable-hid;  Only kernels 2.6.18 or older need it.)
  wacom_drv.o: built by default (--enable-wacomdrv, --disable-wacomdrv)

There are many options, and configure will attempt to guess the correct
values for most of them.  By default, only wacomcpl, xsetwacom,  wacom_drv.o, 
xidump, and wacdump program are built.

Please surf the HOWTO page at http://linuxwacom.sf.net/index.php/howto/main 
(or the miniHOWTO at http://linuxwacom.sourceforge.net/index.php/minihowto if 
you run a Fedora system) to find the proper options if the default building 
environment doesn't work for you.
