This package provides the X.Org X11 driver for Wacom and Wacom-like tablets.
It obsoletes the linuxwacom driver and supports X server versions 1.7 and
higher. Server versions lower than 1.7 may be supported by this driver, but
users are encouraged to use the old linuxwacom driver instead.

Information about building this driver, configuration and general use is
available on http://linuxwacom.sourceforge.net

Since this driver is an X11 driver only, a kernel driver is required to get
hardware support. If the kernel driver is older than this driver, some
features may not be available.
