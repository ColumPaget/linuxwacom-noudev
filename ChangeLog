        * Support Tablet PC Buttons. Default is off.

                xsetwacom set $device tpcbutton 0  (to turn it off)
        * Turned configure option "--disable-wacom" as default
	* Added wacom_drv.o into the install script so wacom_drv.o
                will be installed along with the other executables

		system to install the Wacom X driver related items 
		without rebuilding them on the targeted system.
		Where "identical" means both systems have the same version
                of XFree86, tcl, and tk.

                After building and testing the package on the development
                system, copy the whole package directory onto the
                "identical" system, then
