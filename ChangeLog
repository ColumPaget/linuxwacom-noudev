2003-11-26    Ping Cheng <pingc@wacom.com>
        * Support Tablet PC Buttons. Default is off.
          Usage:
                xsetwacom set $device tpcbutton 1  (to turn it on)
                xsetwacom set $device tpcbutton 0  (to turn it off)
        * Turned configure option "--disable-wacom" as default
	* Added wacom_drv.o into the install script so wacom_drv.o
                will be installed along with the other executables  
		and libs when "make install" is issued.
                This enables the systems "identical" to the development 
		system to install the Wacom X driver related items 
		without rebuilding them on the targeted system.
		Where "identical" means both systems have the same version
                of XFree86, tcl, and tk. 
          Usage:
                After building and testing the package on the development
                system, copy the whole package directory onto the
                "identical" system, then
                cd $package_home_dir
                su
                make install
