.SH DESCRIPTION
.B wacom 
is an X input driver for Wacom devices.
.PP
The
.B wacom
driver functions as a pointer input device, and may be used as the
X server's core pointer.
.SH SUPPORTED HARDWARE
This driver supports the Wacom IV and Wacom V protocols. Serial tablets only 
need this driver.  USB tablet support is available on some Linux platforms. 
USB tablets needs wacom kernel driver being loaded before this driver starts.  
Please check linuxwacom.sf.net for latest updates of Wacom X and kernel drivers.
.SH CONFIGURATION DETAILS
Please refer to xorg.conf(5x) for general configuration
details and for options that can be used with all input drivers.  This
section only covers configuration details specific to this driver.
.PP
Multiple instances of the Wacom devices can cohabit. It can be useful
to define multiple devices with different active zones. Each device
supports the following entries:
.RS 8
.TP 4
.B Option \fI"Type"\fP \fI"stylus"|"eraser"|"cursor"|"pad"|"touch"\fP
sets the type of tool the device represents. This option is mandatory.  
The core options, such as "SendCoreEvents" or "AlwaysCore", are  
unnecessary in Gimp if you don't need to move system cursor outside 
of Gimp drawing area.  "pad" is for Intuos 3 or Cintiq 21UX tablet 
ExpressKeys/menu strips, and Graphire 4 or Bamboo tablet buttons, wheel, 
and/or ring.  It is required  for Intuos3,  CintiqV5, Graphire 4, and 
Bamboo if you want to use keystroke features.  "pad" is reported as a 
second tool in the driver. "touch" is for the tablet with touch support. 
Right now only a few Tablet PCs have this feature. 
.TP 4
.B Option \fI"Device"\fP \fI"path"\fP
sets the path to the special file which represents serial line where
the tablet is plugged.  You have to specify it for each subsection with
the same value if you want to have multiple devices with the same tablet.
This option is mandatory.
.TP 4
.B Option \fI"USB"\fP \fI"on"\fP
tells the driver to dialog with the tablet the USB way.  This option is
mandatory for USB tablets.
.TP 4
.B Option \fI"ForceDevice"\fP \fI"ISDV4"\fP
tells the driver to dialog with the tablet the Tablet PC way.  Right now 
we only support serial Tablet PC. It is a special Wacom IV protocol, 
called ISDV4 protocol.  This option is mandatory for Tablet PC.
.TP 4
.B Option \fI"Suppress"\fP \fI"Inumber"\fP
sets the position increment under which not to transmit coordinates.
This entry must be specified only in the first Wacom subsection if you have
multiple devices for one tablet. If you don't specify this entry, the default value,
which is 2, will be used. To disable suppression, the entry should be specified as 0.
When suppress is defined,  an event will be sent only when at least one of the 
following conditions is met:

        the change between the current X coordinate and the previous one is
greater than suppress;

        the change between the current Y coordinate and the previous one is
greater than suppress;

        the change between the current pressure and the previous one is
greater than suppress;

        the change between the  current degree of rotation and the previous
one of the transducer is greater than suppress;

        the change between the current absolute wheel value and the previous 
one is equal to or greater than suppress;

        the change between the current tilt value and the previous one is equal 
to or greater than suppress (if tilt is supported);

        relative wheel value has changed;

        button value has changed;

        proximity has changed.
.TP 4
.B Option \fI"Mode"\fP \fI"Relative"|"Absolute"\fP
sets the mode of the device.  The default value for stylus and 
eraser is Absolute; cursor is Relative; pad mode is decided 
according to its core option due to its nature of not moving 
system cursor: Relative if it is a core device; Absolute, otherwise;
touch is always in absolute mode.
.TP 4
.B Option \fI"TopX"\fP \fI"number"\fP
X coordinate of the top corner of the active zone.  Default to 0. 
.TP 4
.B Option \fI"TopY"\fP \fI"number"\fP
Y coordinate of the top corner of the active zone.  Default to 0.
.TP 4
.B Option \fI"BottomX"\fP \fI"Inumber"\fP
X coordinate of the bottom corner of the active zone.  Default to width of the tablet.
.TP 4
.B Option \fI"BottomY"\fP \fI"number"\fP
Y coordinate of the bottom corner of the active zone.  Default to height of the tablet.
.TP 4
.B Option \fI"ButtonsOnly"\fP \fI"on"\fP
disables the device's motion events.  Default to off.
.TP 4
.B Option \fI"ButtonM"\fP \fI"AC"\fP
reports an action AC when button M is pressed,  where M 
is one of the device supported  button numbers,  it can be 1 
to 32. The default action reported to Xinput is mouse button M click.    
To ignore the button click, i.e., to not report any button click event 
to Xinput,  use "0" or "button 0".  
.TP 4
.B Option \fI"TPCButton"\fP \fI"on"\fP
enables the stylus buttons as  Tablet PC buttons,  i.e., reports stylus button
event only when its tip is pressed.  Default to "on" for Tablet PC; "off" for all other models.
.TP 4
.B Option \fI"Touch"\fP \fI"on"\fP
enables the touch event for Tablet PC that supports touch feature,  i.e., system cursor moves 
when user touches the tablet.  Default to "on" for Tablet PC with touch feature; "off" for all other models.
.TP 4
.B Option \fI"Speed"\fP \fI"Rspeed"\fP
sets the cursor's relative movement speed to Rspeed.  The default value is 1.0.  
A Rspeed greater than 1.0 will speed up the cursor's relative movement.  A Rspeed 
less than 1.0 but greater than 0 will slow down the cursor's relative movement. 
A Rspeed too close to 0 is not recommanded.
.TP 4
.B Option \fI"Twinview"\fP \fI"horizontal"|"vertical"|"none"\fP
sets the orientation of TwinView to map the tablet to one screen and to be able 
to move the screen cursor from one screen to the other when tool reaches the 
edge of the tablet.  The cursor can be constrained in a specific screen if 
"ScreenNo" option is added.  If you  want to map the tablet to the whole desktop,   
you should NOT add this option.  The default is "none".
.TP 4
.B Option \fI"TVResolution"\fP \fI"res1,res2"\fP
specifies different resolutions for the two screens in TwinView setup.  For example, 
if the resolution of screen 1 (res1) is 1024x768 and screen 2 (res2) is 1280x1024, 
the option will be set to:
            Option "TVResolution" "1024x768,1280x1024" 

This option is used only when TwinView option is not none.  It is unnecessary to add 
this option if your screens are displaying in the same resolutions.
.TP 4
.B Option \fI"ScreenNo"\fP \fI"n"\fP
In a multi-monitor environment, specifies the screen number in which the cursor can move.
.TP 4
.B Option \fI"Rotate"\fP \fI"CW"|"CCW"|"HALF"|"NONE"\fP
rotates the tablet orientation clockwise (CCW) or anti-clockwise (CW) or 180 degrees (HALF). The default is "NONE".
.TP 4
.B Option \fI"PressCurve"\fP \fI"x1,y1,x2,y2"\fP
sets pressure curve by control points x1, y1, x2, and y2.  Their values are in range 
from 0..100. The input for 
	linear curve (default) is "0,0,100,100"; 
	slightly depressed curve (firmer) might be "5,0,100,95"; 
	slightly raised curve (softer) might be "0,5,95,100".
.TP 4
.B Option \fI"KeepShape"\fP \fI"on"\fP
When this option is enabled, the active zone  begins according to TopX
and TopY.  The bottom corner is adjusted to keep the ratio width/height
of the active zone the same as the screen while maximizing the area
described by TopX, TopY, BottomX, BottomY.
.TP 4
.B Option \fI"DebugLevel"\fP \fI"number"\fP
sets the level of debugging info reported.  There are 12 levels, specified by 
the integers between 1 and 12.  Once it is defined, all the debug messages 
with a level less than or equal to the "number" will be logged into 
/etc/X11/Xorg.0.log.
.TP 4
.B Option \fI"CommonDBG"\fP \fI"number"\fP
sets the level of debugging info for all devices defined for the  
same tablet. There are 12 levels in use, specified by the 
integers between 1 and 12. Once it is defined, all the debug 
messages with a level less than or equal to the "number" will 
be logged into /etc/X11/Xorg.0.log.
.TP 4
.B Option \fI"CursorProx"\fP \fI"number"\fP
sets the max distance from tablet to stop reporting movement for cursor in relative mode. Default for Intuos series is 10, for Graphire series (including Volitos) is 42.
.TP 4
.B Option \fI"Serial"\fP \fI"number"\fP
sets the serial number associated with the physical device. This allows
to have multiple devices of the same type (i.e. multiple pens). This
option is only available on wacom V devices (Intuos series and Cintiq 21U). 
To see which serial number belongs to a device, you need to run the utility program, xsetwacom, which comes with linuxwacom package.
.TP 4
.B Option \fI"Threshold"\fP \fI"number"\fP
sets the pressure threshold used to generate a button 1 events of stylus.
The default is MaxPressure*3/50.
