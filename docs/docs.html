<a name="WHO">
</a><h3><a name="WHO">Who is responsible for this code?</a></h3>

<p><a name="WHO">We are.  That is, Linux users with Wacom tablets are responsible for
the development of this code.  The source code
was written by at least two dozen individuals, none of whom still seem to
be directly involved in the project.  I, John Joganic, took up the code in
November of 2002, largely to satisfy my own needs, but also because I believe
Linux needs to be more useful in the graphic and video industries.  What I
ask of you, is to use the drivers and report the problems you encounter.

</a><a name="SUPPORT">
</a></p><h3><a name="SUPPORT">Is my tablet supported?  What about my special stylus?</a></h3>

<p><a name="SUPPORT">The </a><a href="#main">main page</a> contains
a list of all tablets that are known to be
supported.  Tablets with "(beta)" appended are only supported in the
beta drivers at present.

<a name="OTHERS">
</a></p><h3><a name="OTHERS">What about my Penpartner/Graphire/Cintiq?</a></h3>

<a name="OTHERS">The USB kernel driver currently seems to support Penpartner, Graphire,
Graphire2, Intuos, Intuos2, and PL400-800.  Based on user reports, the
Cintiqs may identify themselves as PL series tablets.
There is no kernel driver necessary for serial tablets.
The XFree86 wacom driver supports both USB and serial devices.  It has
support for all the USB devices as well as virtually all of the older
tablet models as well.  Depending on how the Cintiq identifies itself,
it may potentially work with the XFree86 driver as a serial device.  There
are no guarantees as of yet, so I would not buy one (currently over $3000
USD) on the assumption that it will work without doing some actual research.

</a><a name="SPURIOUS">
</a><h3><a name="SPURIOUS">How do I get my stylus to stop clicking randomly whenever I use it?</a></h3>

<p><a name="SPURIOUS">The "Threshold" setting in the InputDevice section of the XFree86
configuration file determines the minimum pressure value before a touch
event is detected.  Wacdump can show you what pressure values are actually
being received from the tablet, and setting the threshold to a value higher
than that should solve the problem.  My stylus oscillates between 0 and 6,
even if the stylus is not touching the tablet.  I use a threshold of 10.</a></p>

<a name="FILTER">
</a><h3><a name="FILTER">The old drivers had filtering, how do I enable it now?</a></h3>

<p><a name="FILTER">At some point, the maintainers of the wacom kernel driver ripped out
all the good features and moved them into the xf86Wacom driver.  Not
everything works as well as one might like.  The "Suppress" setting in
the InputDevice section specifies the tablet sensitivity.

</a><a name="FEATURE">
</a></p><h3><a name="FEATURE">What happened to feature XYZ?</a></h3>

<p><a name="FEATURE">As mentioned above, many of the features in the original kernel driver
were removed and transferred to the xf86Wacom driver.  Not all the features
made the trip.  The goal of this website is to have all the original features
working again as well as all the features available for the windows driver.
If your favorite feature is not working, drop me a line.  I prioritize my
work based on my perception of user need.

</a><a name="BUSTED">
</a></p><h3><a name="BUSTED">How do I get the special features of my stylus to work?</a></h3>

<p><a name="BUSTED">There are many different types of styluses, mice, and cursors.  All of them
work to varying degrees, so if you are running into trouble, send me email.
Also, if you are having trouble with the stable build, try the beta.  Many
of the tools have been recently added and have not yet been moved to the
production release.

<br>
</a><ul><li><a id="/index.php/usb-howto/usb">4.1</a> - <a href="http://linuxwacom.localhost.localdomain/index.php/usb-howto/usb">Linux Wacom Project USB HOWTO</a></li></ul><a name="help">

<center><h2><a name="help">Having trouble?  Help is available.</a></h2></center>

<a name="help"><br><br>

</a><h3><a name="help">Help for gurus and newbies alike.</a></h3>

<p><a name="help"><b>If you are a first-time Linux user</b>, I can tell you right now that this
process is not as simple as a package install.  The goal of this project is
to make it just that simple for you.  If you are running Redhat, Mandrake,
Suse, or any distribution that caters to non-gurus, you should be home free.

</a></p><p><a name="help"><b>For more experienced Linux users</b>, getting your tablet working is not
difficult and probably will not even require a complete kernel build.  At
least one kernel module needs rebuilding and possibly the XFree86 wacom
driver.  There is a diagnostic application for testing USB and serial tablets.

<br><br><br>
</a></p><h3><a name="help">Step 1 - Are you using the correct software?</a></h3>

<p><a name="help">The following configuration is known to work on various platforms.
Additionally, I recommend using the beta version of linuxwacom, at least
while diagnosing your tablet.

</a></p><blockquote><ul>
<a name="help">	<li>Kernel: 2.4.18 and up, preferably 2.4.20
	</li><li>XFree86: 3.9 and up, preferably 4.2
	</li><li>linuxwacom: </li></a><a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/linuxwacom/linuxwacom-0.3.7-beta.tar.gz">linuxwacom-0.3.7-beta</a></ul></blockquote>

<p>You will need to be running at least kernel 2.4.18, preferably 2.4.20.
You should be aware that Redhat and other vendors will back-port features
from newer kernels into their older packages, so if you are running Redhat's
kernel-2.4.18-19.8.0.rpm package, you are actually running something half-way
between 2.4.19 and 2.4.20.  

</p><p>The serial and USB wacom tablets work with XFree86 3.9 and up, but
realistically, you should be running 4.1 or higher.  This package maintains
a prebuilt driver for XFree86 4.2 which runs correctly
with Redhat 8.0.  Debian Stable users are presently using 4.1 and
likewise need to build their own.  Instructions for this are available
in the USB HOWTO under documentation.

</p><p>The current beta version, which I recommend if you cannot get your tablet
working, is <a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/linuxwacom/linuxwacom-0.3.7-beta.tar.gz">linuxwacom-0.3.7-beta</a>.  This contains many new features that have not been completely tested,
but may be the difference between getting your tablet working or not.  If
you are running the stable package and your mouse does not work correctly,
please try the beta package before doing anything else.

<br><br><br>
</p><h3>Step 2 - Have you read the appropriate HOWTO?</h3>

<p>The <a href="#usb">USB HOWTO</a> is a bit long,
but it is comprehensive.  If you cannot get your tablet working after
going through the entire thing, please let me know so we can update it
to better handle your situation.

</p><p>There is no serial HOWTO at this time, but it is substantially less
complicated than the USB configuration.  See the
<a href="#resources">Resources and References</a> section
of the USB HOWTO for Fredrick Lepied's XInput Page.  It contains
the basic XFree86 configuration that you will need.  As for the XFree86 driver,
see the <a href="#x11">Configuring XFree86</a> section in
the USB HOWTO for installation.

<br><br><br>
</p><h3>Step 3 - Have you tested your tablet's output with wacdump?</h3>

<p>The wacdump diagnostic program helps determine whether your tablet is
working correctly, partially, or not at all.  Additionally, the program that
is available in the beta release works for both USB and serial tablets.
It defaults to the USB input device so serial tablet owners will need to
specify the serial device directly (e.g. /dev/ttyS0) with the -d option.

<br><br><br>
</p><h3>Step 4 - Have you checked the online resources?</h3>

There is an <a href="#faq">FAQ</a> for some of the more general questions.  Certainly, you've
already been there.  There are <i>four</i> mailing lists, including
archives.  They are 
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum=linuxwacom-announce">linuxwacom-announce</a>,
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum=linuxwacom-devel">linuxwacom-devel</a>,
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum=linuxwacom-discuss">linuxwacom-discuss</a>,
and the original
<a href="http://www.lepied.com/archive_wacom.html">mailing list</a>
hosted by Fredrick Lepied.
SourceForge also provides the ability to
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=69596&amp;atid=525124">track bugs</a>
and request features.
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/forum/?group_id=69596">Forums</a> are available on SourceForge, but the preferred way to be heard is
through the linuxwacom-discuss mailing list.

<br><br><br>
<h3>Step 5 - Totally and Completely Stumped?</h3>

<a href="mailto:jej@j-arkadia.com?SUBJECT=WACOM">Send me email</a>,
and I'll see what I can do.  Please include the word WACOM
in the subject field so I can sort it out of the mess that is my inbox.
Generally, you will get a faster response (from me even), if you post to
the linuxwacom-discuss mailing list.

59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA<br>
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br>
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>
<br>
0. PREAMBLE<br>
<br>
</a><p><a name="lic">The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook,
or other functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or
without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially. Secondarily,
this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get credit for
their work, while not being considered responsible for modifications made
by others.  </a></p><p><a name="lic">This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means
that derivative works of the document must themselves be free in the same
sense. It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
license designed for free software.  </a></p><p><a name="lic">We have designed this License in order to use it
for manuals for free software, because free software needs free documentation:
a free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that
the software does. But this License is not limited to software manuals; it
can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether
it is published as a printed book. We recommend this License principally
for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.  </a></p><p><a name="lic">1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

</a></p><p><a name="lic">This License applies to any manual or other work,
in any medium, that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying
it can be distributed under the terms of this License. Such a notice grants
a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that work
under the conditions stated herein. The "Document", below, refers to any
such manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed
as "you". You accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work
in a way requiring permission under copyright law.  </a></p><p><a name="lic">A "Modified Version" of the Document means any
work containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim,
or with modifications and/or translated into another language.  </a></p><p><a name="lic">A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a
front-matter section of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship
of the publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject
(or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within
that overall subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics,
a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could
be a matter of historical connection with the subject or with related matters,
or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
them.  </a></p><p><a name="lic">The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary
Sections whose titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections,
in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License.
If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not
allowed to be designated as Invariant. The Document may contain zero Invariant
Sections. If the Document does not identify any Invariant Sections then there
are none.  </a></p><p><a name="lic">The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of
text that are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice
that says that the Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover
Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words. 
 </a></p><p><a name="lic">A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable
copy, represented in a format whose specification is available to the general
public, that is suitable for revising the document straightforwardly with
generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs
or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable
for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of
formats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise
Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged
to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.
An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of
text. A copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".  </a></p><p><a name="lic">Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies
include plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,
SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple
HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification. Examples of transparent
image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats include proprietary
formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors,
SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available,
and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors
for output purposes only.  </a></p><p><a name="lic">The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the
title page itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly,
the material this License requires to appear in the title page. For works
in formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means the
text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title, preceding the
beginning of the body of the text.  </a></p><p><a name="lic">A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit
of the Document whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses
following text that translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands
for a specific section name mentioned below, such as "Acknowledgements",
"Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".) To "Preserve the Title" of
such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a section
"Entitled XYZ" according to this definition.  </a></p><p><a name="lic">The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next
to the notice which states that this License applies to the Document. These
Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this License,
but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other implication that these
Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has no effect on the meaning of
this License.  </a></p><p><a name="lic">2. VERBATIM COPYING

</a></p><p><a name="lic">You may copy and distribute the Document in any
medium, either commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License,
the copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other conditions
whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use technical measures to
obstruct or control the reading or further copying of the copies you make
or distribute. However, you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.
If you distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the
conditions in section 3.  </a></p><p><a name="lic">You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you may publicly display copies.

</a></p><p><a name="lic">3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

</a></p><p><a name="lic">If you publish printed copies (or copies in media
that commonly have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100,
and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose
the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts:
Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.
Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of
these copies. The front cover must present the full title with all words
of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add other material on
the covers in addition. Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long
as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions,
can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.  </a></p><p><a name="lic">If the required texts for either cover are too
voluminous to fit legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many
as fit reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
pages.  </a></p><p><a name="lic">If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the
Document numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable
Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque
copy a computer-network location from which the general network-using public
has access to download using public-standard network protocols a complete
Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. If you use the
latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution
of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain
thus accessible at the stated location until at least one year after the
last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents
or retailers) of that edition to the public.  </a></p><p><a name="lic">It is requested, but not required, that you contact
the authors of the Document well before redistributing any large number of
copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the
Document.  </a></p><p><a name="lic">4. MODIFICATIONS

</a></p><p><a name="lic">You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of
the Document under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that
you release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and
modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In
addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:  </a></p><ul>
<li><a name="lic">A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a
title distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
(which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section of the
Document). You may use the same title as a previous version if the original
publisher of that version gives permission. </a></li><li><a name="lic">B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or
more persons or entities responsible for authorship of the modifications
in the Modified Version, together with at least five of the principal authors
of the Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five),
unless they release you from this requirement. </a></li><li><a name="lic">C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified Version, as the publisher.
</a></li><li><a name="lic">D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
</a></li><li><a name="lic">E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to the other copyright notices.
</a></li><li><a name="lic">F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices,
a license notice giving the public permission to use the Modified Version
under the terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below. 
</a></li><li><a name="lic">G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists
of Invariant Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license
notice. </a></li><li><a name="lic">H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.
</a></li><li><a name="lic">I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve
its Title, and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors,
and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page. If there
is no section Entitled "History" in the Document, create one stating the
title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as given on its Title
Page, then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the previous
sentence. </a></li><li><a name="lic">J. Preserve the network location, if any, given
in the Document for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document,
and likewise the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
it was based on. These may be placed in the "History" section. You may omit
a network location for a work that was published at least four years before
the Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers
to gives permission. </a></li><li><a name="lic">K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements"
or "Dedications", Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the
section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements
and/or dedications given therein. </a></li><li><a name="lic">L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the
Document, unaltered in their text and in their titles. Section numbers or
the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles. </a></li><li><a name="lic">M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements". Such a section may not be included in the Modified Version.
</a></li><li><a name="lic">N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled "Endorsements" or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.
</a></li><li><a name="lic">O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.
</a></li></ul>

<p><a name="lic">If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections
or appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all of
these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list of
Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice. These titles
must be distinct from any other section titles.  </a></p><p><a name="lic">You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements",
provided it contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by
various parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text
has been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
standard.  </a></p><p><a name="lic">You may add a passage of up to five words as a
Front-Cover Text, and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to
the end of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage
of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through
arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document already includes a
cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or by arrangement
made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another;
but you may replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous
publisher that added the old one.  </a></p><p><a name="lic">The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document
do not by this License give permission to use their names for publicity for
or to assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.  </a></p><p><a name="lic">5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

</a></p><p><a name="lic">You may combine the Document with other documents
released under this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and list
them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its license notice,
and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.  </a></p><p><a name="lic">The combined work need only contain one copy of
this License, and multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with
a single copy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name
but different contents, make the title of each such section unique by adding
at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher
of that section if known, or else a unique number. Make the same adjustment
to the section titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice
of the combined work.  </a></p><p><a name="lic">In the combination, you must combine any sections
Entitled "History" in the various original documents, forming one section
Entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled "Acknowledgements",
and any sections Entitled "Dedications". You must delete all sections Entitled
"Endorsements."  </a></p><p><a name="lic">6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

</a></p><p><a name="lic">You may make a collection consisting of the Document
and other documents released under this License, and replace the individual
copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy that is
included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License
for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.  </a></p><p><a name="lic">You may extract a single document from such a collection,
and distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a
copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this License
in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.  </a></p><p><a name="lic">7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

</a></p><p><a name="lic">A compilation of the Document or its derivatives
with other separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume
of a storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the copyright
resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights of the
compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. When the Document
is included an aggregate, this License does not apply to the other works
in the aggregate which are not themselves derivative works of the Document. 
 </a></p><p><a name="lic">If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable
to these copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half
of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on covers
that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the electronic equivalent
of covers if the Document is in electronic form. Otherwise they must appear
on printed covers that bracket the whole aggregate.  </a></p><p><a name="lic">8. TRANSLATION

</a></p><p><a name="lic">Translation is considered a kind of modification,
so you may distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
4. Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission
from their copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or
all Invariant Sections in addition to the original versions of these Invariant
Sections. You may include a translation of this License, and all the license
notices in the Document, and any Warrany Disclaimers, provided that you also
include the original English version of this License and the original versions
of those notices and disclaimers. In case of a disagreement between the translation
and the original version of this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original
version will prevail.  </a></p><p><a name="lic">If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
"Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve its
Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual title.  </a></p><p><a name="lic">9. TERMINATION

</a></p><p><a name="lic">You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute
the Document except as expressly provided for under this License. Any other
attempt to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and
will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties
who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not
have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance. 
 </a></p><p><a name="lic">10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

</a></p><p><a name="lic">The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised
versions of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ
in detail to address new problems or concerns. See http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/. 
 </a></p><p><a name="lic">Each version of the License is given a distinguishing
version number. If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version
of this License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option
of following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the Free
Software Foundation. If the Document does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft)
by the Free Software Foundation.  </a></p><p><a name="lic">HOW TO USE THIS LICENSE FOR YOUR DOCUMENTS

</a></p><p><a name="lic">To use this License in a document you have written,
include a copy of the License in the document and put the following copyright
and license notices just after the title page:  </a></p><blockquote><pre><a name="lic">      Copyright (c)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
      Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
      under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2
      or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
      with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts.
      A copy of the license is included in the section entitled "GNU
      Free Documentation License".
</a></pre></blockquote>

<p><a name="lic">If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts, replace the "with...Texts." line with this:

</a></p><blockquote><pre><a name="lic">    with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the
    Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.
</a></pre></blockquote>

<p><a name="lic">If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some
other combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.  </a></p><p><a name="lic">If your document contains nontrivial examples of
program code, we recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your
choice of free software license, such as the GNU General Public License,
to permit their use in free software. </a></p></td></tr></tbody></table></center>
