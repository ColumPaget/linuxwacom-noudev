<H1>1.0 - Introduction</H1>
<P>This document was written for three reasons: 1) to remind myself
how I got my brand-new Wacom Intuos2 running on my Redhat 8.0 Linux box in
case I have to do it again from scratch, 2) to help other people do the same,
and 3) to help de-mystify the process by explaining why things work as they
do, and where to look when things seem to be going wrong. 

<P>If you find an error, have a question, or have something to add, please
contact me directly at
<A HREF="mailto:jej@j-arkadia.com?subject=WACOM">jej@j-arkadia.com</A>.
Furthermore, please add the word "WACOM" to the subject line.  I get hundreds
of messages a day, so that'll help me see your message amidst the spam.
<A NAME="expect">
<H2>1.1 - Expectations</H2>
<H2>What You Can Expect Today</H2>

<P>Depending on whether you are using serial or USB tablets, your experience
will differ, but for the moment at least, the serial tablets have a generally
simpler configuration.  This document currently addresses only the USB
tablets, but that will change in the future.  Mr. Lepied's
<A HREF="http://people.mandrakesoft.com/~flepied/projects/wacom/">XInput driver for XFree86</A> web page
has a good description of the serial configuration process.  The goal of
this website is to make configuration and use of both tablet types as
simple as possible.  Here is what you can expect now:

<H3>You Should Be Able to Get Your Tablet Working</H3>

<P>Most all serial and USB tablets are working to a reasonably functional
degree.  I have an old ArtPad (1997) that does not initialize with the
XFree86 driver, and USB Cintiq users are having a little trouble with the
kernel drivers.  Everyone else should be up and running, namely:

<UL>
<LI>PenPartner,
<LI>Graphire,
<LI>Graphire2,
<LI>Intuos, and
<LI>Intuos2
</UL>

<H3>All Your Fancy Styluses and Pointers Should Work</H3>

<P>I have a collection of pointers, pens, and brushes to test; all of them
work completely as one would expect.  Users have reported success with
their tools as well.  I have not tested the airbrush yet, but presumably
it works just fine.  Tools that are known to work include:

<UL>
<LI>Graphire2 2D mouse (EC-120-0K),
<LI>Intuos Pen (GP-300E-01H),
<LI>Intuos2 2D mouse,
<LI>Intuos2 4D mouse,
<LI>Intuos2 Lens cursor,
<LI>Intuos2 grip pen (XP-501E-00A),
<LI>Intuos2 stroke pen (XP-120-00A),
<LI>Intuos2 ink pen (XP-110-00A),
</UL>

<H3>You Will Need to Modify Your XF86Config File</H3>

<P>This project is actively working to become a turn-key system.  It will be
awhile before major distributions like Redhat include these settings
automatically for you.  Until that time, you will need to make some changes
to your XFree86 configuration files by hand.

<H3>You May Need to Update Your Kernel</H3>

<P>This project assumes that you have a kernel version of at least 2.4.18.
While it may be possible to use this document with older kernels, the
likelihood of success diminishes the farther back you go.  Redhat 8.0
ships with this kernel, and most of the major distributions are already
past this point.

<H3>You Will Need to Work With the Command Line</H3>

<P>This document details a step-by-step process for setting up and diagnosing
the tablet.  There are no GUI tools to help you through this process- at
least not today.  Some familiarity with the command line is recommended
since I provide enough information to get the task accomplished, but I do
not explain how the command line itself operates.  Any good book on UNIX
will do, and I use the bash shell for all my work.  If you are not using
bash, you presumably know what you are doing already.

<H2>What You Can Expect Soon</H2>

<P>I have a near-term design goal to get all the tablets and their respective
tools functioning using the original driver design.  This currently includes
the airbrush (which may work already), the Cintiq, and if possible and time
permits, the lowly ArtPad.  If there are any outstanding problems with the
original driver, I will take care of them as they come up.

<P>While the current way of configuring the tablet is sub-par in my opinion,
it is also the established way of doing things.  Merging large-scale changes
back into either the Linux kernel or the XFree86 code tree will be difficult,
if for no other reason than insufficient multi-platform testing.  To solve
this problem, the new functionality described below will be implemented in
a separate project and accessed through the original driver as an advanced
option.  This will allow all the various platforms to use the new code or not
depending on their own constraints and circumstances.  It also allows for
people to write their own tablet libraries without mucking around in the
XFree86 code.

<H2>The Next Steps</H2>

<P>First and foremost, the tablet needs to be configurable without restarting
X.  By separating the tablet code from the low-level X code, it will be
possible to talk directly to the tablet engine without interfering
with the X server's operation.  Additionally, it will be possible to use
either the XInput configuration API or the tablet engine's API to access
that functionality.  The preferred way would probably be an X server
extension, but today at least, that is outside of the scope of my interest.
Ask me again in another month.

<P>The next issue is plug and play.  The USB tablets have the
unfriendly habit of being unaccessible when they are unplugged and replugged.
Since the X server holds the device open, the tablets cannot reconnect to
their original position and get bumped to another event slot.  The new
tablet engine will address the problem, and can probably even auto-probe
for the USB tablets.

<P>Third, a GUI-based configuration tool should cap things off nicely.  I
intend to replicate the functionality of the Windows configuration tool.
This includes diagnostics, pressure mappings, button settings, keyboard
mappings, etc.

<H2>Your Role</H2>

I have some expectations as well.  If you have a Wacom tablet and you
use this code, I would appreciate it if you could test the beta releases
whenever a feature or issue that might affect you comes up.  The sooner
that problems are resolved, the less likely you will be impacted by a
buggy production release.  If you only use the stable builds, none of
the new features will be available to you until after they have been
thoroughly hammered out which could be awhile.  Of course, nothing is
stopping you from using the stable builds; they are purposefully
made available for people and companies who need the tablet drivers as
stable as possible.
<A NAME="updates">
<H2>1.2 - Most Recent Updates</H2>

<P>This is a list of the updates for the past month or so.  The <A HREF="#changelog">Changelog</A> has a more complete
list.

<P>December 22, 2002 - Added support for the serial Intuos2 under xf86Wacom.c.
Fixed the sign convention on the mouse wheel for USB Intuos mice.  Graphire
should be fixed, too.  Added preliminary support for Volito to kernel driver.
Cleaned up wacdump and hid-core to compile on Debian Woody without
warnings.  Added build help for Debian Stable users.  Added ability to read
serial devices using wacdump.  New package is 0.3.3-beta.

<P>December 15, 2002 - Added initial framework for new driver code.  Fixed
the mouse wheel for 4D mice.  Fairly responsive, almost too responsive, in
fact. (Updated: quick fix to xf86Wacom.c to remove some debugging code that
got left in accidentally; new driver version is 0.3.2a, but the package is
the same.)

<P>December 13, 2002 - Added development page.  New beta build has fix for
2D mouse wheel.  Wacdump displays relative data now.  Build environment for
wacom_drv.o set up for new code.

<P>December 9, 2002 - Added more information about the parameters accepted
by the InputDevice section, including the man pages.

<P>November 24, 2002 - Moved beta tree to version 0.2.0.  Added complete
configure-based environment.  wacom.o and wacdump are built by default;
wacom_drv.o is available in binary and source form.

<H2>1.4 - How To Use This Document</H2>
<BLOCKQUOTE><DIV CLASS=diff>
Where the guide differs between distributions or packages, I have added a
comment like this to help distinguish between versions.
</DIV></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>In terms of document organization, if you have not figured it out already,
you can browse the document one page at a time, or you can click on the
ALL link and view the entire thing in one long page.

<P>Next, this document was written with the
assumption that you are starting from
scratch with a relatively recent distribution of the Linux kernel.  Also,
if you have already added lines to your X11 configuration file (XF86Config),
you should comment them out and restart X.  Since we'll be stepping through
the entire process, we need X to ignore the tablet until we're ready.
Otherwise, X will just get in the way.

<P>Finally, if you know what you're doing, you can leave your X settings
intact, print this out, switch to runlevel 3, and follow along from the
console.  The newer packages should have an HTML and text version of this
document in the documentation directory.  And of course, there's always
<A HREF=http://lynx.isc.org/>lynx</A> for the gurus out there, which is
why this document is written out in plain vanilla HTML.

<A NAME=WHO>
<H3>Who is responsible for this code?</H3>

<P>We are.  That is, Linux users with Wacom tablets are responsible for
the development of this code.  The source code
was written by at least two dozen individuals, none of whom still seem to
be directly involved in the project.  I, John Joganic, took up the code in
November of 2002, largely to satisfy my own needs, but also because I believe
Linux needs to be more useful in the graphic and video industries.  What I
ask of you, is to use the drivers and report the problems you encounter.

<A NAME=SUPPORT>
<H3>Is my tablet supported?  What about my special stylus?</H3>

<P>Most recent tablets are supported as well all the styluses.  The
<A HREF="#expect">Expectations</A> page has a
list of all the tablets and styluses that are known to work as well
as what you can expect out of these drivers now and in the future.

<A NAME=OTHERS>
<H3>What about my Penpartner/Graphire/Cintiq?</H3>

The USB kernel driver currently seems to support Penpartner, Graphire,
Graphire2, Intuos, Intuos2, and PL400-800.  Based on user reports, the
Cintiqs may identify themselves as PL series tablets.
There is no kernel driver necessary for serial tablets.
The XFree86 wacom driver supports both USB and serial devices.  It has
support for all the USB devices as well as virtually all of the older
tablet models as well.  Depending on how the Cintiq identifies itself,
it may potentially work with the XFree86 driver as a serial device.  There
are no guarantees as of yet, so I would not buy one (currently over $3000
USD) on the assumption that it will work without doing some actual research.

<A NAME=SPURIOUS>
<H3>How do I get my stylus to stop clicking randomly whenever I use it?</H3>

<P>The "Threshold" setting in the InputDevice section of the XFree86
configuration file determines the minimum pressure value before a touch
event is detected.  Wacdump can show you what pressure values are actually
being received from the tablet, and setting the threshold to a value higher
than that should solve the problem.  My stylus oscillates between 0 and 6,
even if the stylus is not touching the tablet.  I use a threshold of 10.</P>

<A NAME=FILTER>
<H3>The old drivers had filtering, how do I enable it now?</H3>

<P>At some point, the maintainers of the wacom kernel driver ripped out
all the good features and moved them into the xf86Wacom driver.  Not
everything works as well as one might like.  The "Suppress" setting in
the InputDevice section specifies the tablet sensitivity.

<A NAME=FEATURE>
<H3>What happened to feature XYZ?</H3>

<P>As mentioned above, many of the features in the original kernel driver
were removed and transferred to the xf86Wacom driver.  Not all the features
made the trip.  The goal of this website is to have all the original features
working again as well as all the features available for the windows driver.
If your favorite feature is not working, drop me a line.  I prioritize my
work based on my perception of user need.

<A NAME=BUSTED>
<H3>How do I get the special features of my stylus to work?</H3>

<P>There are many different types of stylus, mice, and cursors.  All of them
work to varying degrees, so if you are running into trouble, send me email.
There are presently known issues with the mouse wheel on 2D mice (fixed in
0.3.1-beta), and some of the extra buttons on the 4D mice.  While the values
are generally reported correctly to the driver, the xf86Wacom driver does not
interpret the information properly.  The 4D mouse wheel for instance behaves
completely contrary to expectation (fixed in 0.3.2-beta).  These problems will
be addressed in future production releases (and are available now in the beta
releases).

<P>I do not have an airbrush tool at my disposal.  If you have one and it
does not work for you, let me know.  You could be beta-testing the code that
gets this working.

<A NAME="theory">
<H2>1.8 - Wacom Driver Theory of Operation</H2>
<P>Initially at least, the Wacom tablet is an HID compliant device, and when
first connected to the computer, will identify itself as such.
Unfortunately, this is not what you want because in this mode, you will not
get any of the fancy features.  The hid-core.c and usbmouse.c files contain
exceptions for the wacom; when the device is detected, they ignore the
tablet.  In this way, the more sophisticated wacom driver
has the opportunity to assume control.

<P>The first thing that the driver does is register itself with the USB
subsystem and wait for work to do.  When the user plugs the device in, or
the device is first detected, the USB subsystem shops the vendor and
device identifier around, checking it against different drivers.  The
wacom driver takes responsibility for the tablet and then notifies the
event system that it will be providing data.  It then asks the tablet to
switch from HID-compliant mode to "mode 2", a wacom-specific protocol which
allows for values like pressure, Z rotation,
and tilt.  As information arrives, the wacom driver dutifully converts
the data into real-world values and hands it on to the event system.

<P>From here, any usermode application can get access to the event data
by opening /dev/input/event0.  A stream of events including mouse movements,
clicks, and proximity updates can be read from the device.  One such
application that would be interested in this data is the X system itself.
An XInput driver (wacom_drv.o) collects that information,
applies various forms of filtering, and offers it to GUI-based applications
throught the XInput API. A graphics program like gimp can then get access
to the positions of various tools by querying X directly.

<P>By breaking the responsibility for the data into three distinct levels,
we keep the kernel code simple and robust, the applications generalized,
and the fancy features commonly accessible to all GUI applications in the
X window system itself.  This document walks down the entire data path from
the kernel driver to the gimp application.
<A NAME="starthere">
<H1>2.0 - Getting It Together</H1>
<P>This section is devoted to preparing your system for the installation.
In some cases, your distribution may have automatically loaded certain
modules which you will now need to unload.  Incidentally, some distributions
detect new hardware on boot.  If you allow Redhat's "anaconda" for instance
to automatically configure (or remove) your tablet, it may undo some of the
settings you will make here.  Until Redhat's installation program recognizes
Wacom tablets as non-HID devices by default, you are best off in my opinion
to <i>not</i> allow it to configure the device.  Just a warning.
<A NAME="beforestart">
<H2>2.1 - Before We Start</H2>
<P>From the beginning, let's make certain that we are on the

in your XF86Config file, you should comment them out or remove them; then
restart X.<BR>

The kernel now knows nothing about the Wacom or how to handle event-based

<P>Check the presence of the input devices in the /dev/input directory.
You should find approximately 114 devices with names such as event*, mouse*,

<P>On some distributions, Mandrake 9.0 for instance, the /dev directory is
managed by devfs; Redhat 8.0 does not use it.  When devfs is running, the
/dev/input directory and/or its contents may be missing if the driver is not
loaded.  If you are not using devfs and the /dev/input directory or
mouse0/event0 devices are not present, your distribution may be lacking these
devices.  This could be an oversight, or it could be an indication that your
distribution is too old.

<P>If after executing <i>xxd mouse0</i> you <B>did not</B>
receive the "xxd: mouse0: No such device" message, then the input device
is still loaded; go back and try running <i>rmmod evdev</i> again.
Once the new drivers are compiled and installed, this command will stream
information from the Wacom tablet.  mouse0 behaves like a PS/2 style mouse.
event0 provides extensive information about the tablet including position,
tilt, pressure, and buttons.  It can also track at least two different tools
simultaneously (Intuos2).<BR>

<H2>2.3 - Configuring the Package</H2>

Versions of wacpack-0.2.0 and greater are based on GNU's configure script
based build environment.  The upside is that more details are guessed by
default.  The downside is that the default configuration builds only the
kernel driver and wacdump programs (which should cover almost everybody),
but if you need a different module built, you will have to reconfigure the
package first.  This is mostly because different modules have different
dependencies, some of which are difficult to resolve.
A list of the options currently available in the stable package is
presented below.  Remember that for every --enable option, there is also
an equivalent --disable option.

<P>Chances are high that you will be able to run the configure script without
any options and have it execute correctly.  Here is a sample output of the
script on a Redhat 8.0 system:

<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
[jej@ayukawa wacpack]$ ./configure
checking for a BSD-compatible install... /usr/bin/install -c
checking whether build environment is sane... yes
...
checking for processor type... <B>i686</B>
checking for kernel module versioning... <B>yes</B>
checking for kernel sources... <B>/usr/src/linux-2.4</B>
...

----------------------------------------
  BUILD ENVIRONMENT:
       architecture - i686
  module versioning - yes
             kernel - yes
            XFree86 - no

  BUILD OPTIONS:
            wacom.o - yes
            wacdump - yes
              hid.o - no
         usbmouse.o - no
        wacom_drv.o - no
----------------------------------------
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The processor type is determined by the script and used to build the
kernel modules.  Similarily, the script attempts to discover if the kernel
is using module versioning by looking for version numbers in the usb.o
module of the currently active kernel.  This may not work well on all
distributions, so if you get a line like "checking for kernel module versioning... confused" or "maybe; assuming yes", you'll have to manually enable or
disable the option if it guesses incorrectly.

<P>The kernel source directory is assumed to be either /usr/src/linux-2.4
or /usr/src/linux.  If your kernel sources are elsewhere, you will need to
specify the directory with the --with-kernel option.

<P>Generally, you will not need to build wacom_drv.o since it ships in
binary form in the prebuilt directory.  It is compiled with glibc with
gcc 3.2 on a Redhat 8.0 system; if this will not work for you, building
from source may be your only option.  See the
<A HREF="#builddrv">Building wacom_drv.o From Scratch</A> page
for more information.

<P>The configure script is pretty simple, so if you find any problems and
are inclined to fix them, please send me your patch so I can include the
change in future releases.

<P>The following sample command-line will build everything but wacdump
while disabling module versioning:

<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
[jej@ayukawa wacpack]$ ./configure --enable-hid --enable-usbmouse \
	--enable-wacomdrv --with-xf86=/usr/src/redhat/BUILD/XFree86-4.2.0 \

checking for kernel sources... /usr/src/linux-2.4
checking for valid XFree86 build environment... <B>ok</B>
...
----------------------------------------
  BUILD ENVIRONMENT:
       architecture - i686
  module versioning - <B>no</B>
             kernel - yes
            XFree86 - <B>yes</B>

  BUILD OPTIONS:
            wacom.o - yes
            wacdump - <B>no</B>
              hid.o - <B>yes</B>
         usbmouse.o - <B>yes</B>
        wacom_drv.o - <B>yes</B>
----------------------------------------
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Notice that the configure script guessed module versioning was enabled
by default, but was disabled by the command-line option --disable-modver.
Similarly, the wacdump program which is enabled by default was also disabled.
All the kernel modules and the XFree86 wacom driver are enabled.

<P>If the configure script fails to find something that it is looking for,
it may disable some options that you previously enabled on the command-line.
If this happens, check the output for a warning like the following:

<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
***
*** WARNING:
*** Unable to compile wacom_drv.o without XF86 build environment
*** wacom_drv.o will not be built
***

<P>In this particular case, the XFree86 driver was enabled, but the
--with-xf86 option was not specified.  Without the build environment,
the module cannot be compiled and was consequently disabled.
<A NAME="kernel">
<H1>3.0 - The Kernel Driver</H1>
<P>The kernel driver for the Wacom Intuos that ships with the
Linux kernel through 2.4.19, and in particular Redhat 8.0, does
not work correctly.  The bug is pretty simple and you can fix it yourself.
Optionally, you can compile the version that I provide directly and swap
the new module for the old one.  This avoids having to rebuild the entire
kernel.</P>

<P>Kernel modules must be recompiled for each new kernel so I can't
just provide binaries.  By the time you read this, my present kernel
will be entirely out of date with yours.  Additionally, this fix will
appear in 2.4.20, so until you upgrade your kernel to that point, each
time you upgrade to a version less than that, you will need to recompile this
driver and swap it for the old one.  In many cases, distributions like
Redhat will "back-port" the fixes to older kernels, so keep an eye out
for the change.  Your driver may already be fixed.</P>
<A NAME="newwacom">
<H2>3.1 - Updated wacom.c</H2>
The wacom.c driver that is available in <A HREF="/wacom/wacpack-0.2.0.tar.gz">wacpack-0.2.0.tar.gz</A> has a
number of updates which cannot be found in many distributions yet.

<P>First and foremost, it fixes an error that shipped with
the 2.4.19 kernel and was subsequently fixed in 2.4.20.  This bug fix was
made available in the Redhat 8.0 back-ported kernel version 2.4.18-18.x.y.
Other distributions may not yet be updated.

<P>This driver contains several changes provided by Wacom UNIX developer
Ping Cheng.  Items include revised pressure code, better handling of 2D
mice and lens cursors.

<P>The driver also contains additional debugging code which may be useful in
diagnosing data flow problems of which there are many, unfortunately.
<A NAME="buildwacom">
<H2>3.2 - Building wacom.c</H2>
<P>Building the kernel driver requires having the kernel source.  If you
are running on Redhat, you can get it by installing the kernel-source RPM.
At the time of this writing, I have the following RPMs installed:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
kernel-2.4.18-18.8.0<BR>
kernel-2.4.18-14<BR>
kernel-source-2.4.18-18.8.0<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

On a Redhat 8.0 machine, the kernel source is installed to /usr/src/linux-2.4.  You
will need to know where your source is installed to continue with the next
step.  After unpacking the <A HREF="/wacom/wacpack-0.2.0.tar.gz">wacpack-0.2.0.tar.gz</A> file, configure the
package.  If your kernel is not located at either /usr/src/linux-2.4 or
/usr/src/linux, use the --with-kernel option as shown below.  Otherwise,
just run <I>configure</I> without any options.

<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>

<P>If you did not receive an error or warning and the BUILD ENVIRONMENT
summary shows "kernel - yes" then your kernel source tree was detected.
If not, then you will need to look at the error or warning and determine
the correct source directory.  Now is also a good time to verify that the
architecture was correctly detected.  The --with-arch option allows you
to change the value.

<P>Another detail that you need to be concerned about is module
versioning.  If it reads "yes" or "no" then the configure script
has determined the correct setting.  If it says "unknown," then it will
default disabled, and you may have to enable it manually with --enable-modver.
If module versioning is disable when it should be enabled, depmod will
complain about missing symbols.  If it is enabled when it should be disabled,
the code may not compile, and it almost certainly will not load properly.
If in doubt, leave it disabled for now and enable it later if depmod complains.

<P>To build the driver, just run <i>make</i>.  The
output will be a file called wacom.o in the src directory.
This is your replacement driver.
<A NAME="testwacom">
<H2>3.3 - Testing If wacom.o Will Load</H2>
<P>Before we install the wacom driver, we need to test that it will load
properly.  We do this by loading the driver manually.  WARNING: there is a
small chance that this will bomb your kernel, so we run <i>sync</i> to write
all the stale buffers to the disk.  People using ext3 have little to worry
about, but it's always good to be prepared for the worst.  At the very least,
save your work.

<P>Well, if you did not bomb, then good.  And if you did, well, sorry.  So
far, we have not had any reports of this happening, so please send in yours.

<P>If you get errors inserting the module, then you may need to reconfigure
and build with module versioning disabled.  If it loads without a hitch,
move on to the next part.
<A NAME="installwacom">
<H2>3.4 - Installing wacom.o</H2>
<P>To install or not to install, that is the question.
Since the driver is in memory, you can pretty much use it this way
throughout the rest of this document.  Anywhere you see
<i>modprobe wacom</i>, you'll instead need to <i>insmod wacom.o</i>.
You'll also need to be careful that you use the correct path to wacom.o
since insmod will load the driver from the kernel modules directory if it
fails to find the module you specified.  The result is that you'll
be using the wrong driver.

<P>Why would you not install the driver?  Well, for one, you may be using
a beta driver, and if the system crashes (you get an Oops or things come
unglued in other ways), it would be nice to reboot and have the original
drivers load instead.

<P>When should I install the driver?  When you're comfortable that the
driver will not crash your system.  The wacpack tarballs will be marked
as beta if I am not absolutely convinced that they are stable.  On the
other hand, the new features will be in beta tarballs before they are
marked stable, so there you have it.  For the first time through this document,
I would recommend installing the files found in the stable tarball.  If you
really know what you're doing, just load the drivers manually like in the
previous section <A HREF="#testwacom">Testing If wacom.o Will Load</A>.

<P CLASS=diff>On some distributions, Mandrake included, the wacom.o driver
that appears in the kernel modules directory appears to be compressed.  If
you cannot find wacom.o using the method below, try locating wacom.o.gz
instead.  People who encountered this problem were able to run gzip on the
module and copy that instead.</P>

<P>Installing the driver requires knowing where it belongs.  A
little research will help here.  By using the <i>locate</i> command, you
can find all copies of the original driver on the computer.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>

On this computer, there are two kernels installed.  <I>uname</i> identifies
the currently active kernel as 2.4.18-18.8.0.  The correct driver to replace
is therefore at /lib/modules/2.4.18-18.8.0/kernel/drivers/usb/wacom.o.  You
will need to be root to replace this file, and it is a very good idea to
make a backup copy.

<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>

</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>

Here, I've saved the original to wacom_old.o and copied my new driver over it.
Substitute directory names as appropriate.

<P>Finally, it is always a good thing to update the module dependencies.
This is where you find out if the module was compiled without kernel module
versioning.  The following command, even if it generates errors is relatively
benign.  If it fails, then there is no harm done.  It just means that you will
have to load modules in the correct order since the system will not be able to
guess for you.

<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
[jej@ayukawa usb]# depmod -e
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>

If you get no errors and no output, everything is fine, and the module was
compiled, linked, and installed properly.  If you received unresolved symbols
like usb_set_idle or printk, then you need to reconfigure with module
versioning enabled and recompile.  Or not.  As I said, it is not critical.
<A NAME="loadwacom">
<H2>3.5 - Loading the wacom Driver</H2>

<P>If you have installed the driver, now is the time to test whether it will
load when needed.  If you have not installed it, but are instead using insmod,
substitute <i>insmod mydir/wacom/wacom.o</i> where you see
<i>modprobe wacom</i> below.  It is important that you use the correct
wacom.o file, the one you just built, since insmod may load the old driver
if it cannot find the one you have specified.

<P>I am assuming
that you are using a USB device, so you will also need to modprobe for usb-uhci.
The important features of the stylus are available through the Linux event
drivers, so load those too.  With some clever additions to /etc/modules.conf,
you can probably have these automatically loading for you whenever the tablet
is activated.  So far, I haven't figured out how to make this work reliably,
so I've added the commands to my /etc/rc.d/rc.local file.

<BLOCKQUOTE><DIV CLASS=diff>
On Redhat 7.2 and possibly on other older distributions, mousedev and input

driver which should identify the tablet as its own.  Any number of problems

<P>If all went well like above, the USB device was successfully detected and
handled by the wacom driver; secondly, it was assigned input0.  This
presumably means that information like pressure and tilt will be received on
/dev/input/event0. Lastly, the tablet was setup with mousedev or the generic
PS/2 USB mouse driver, so that information should appear on /dev/input/mouse0.

<P>If instead you got any of the following lines in your log, the wacom
driver <i>did not get control</i>.  Either hid or usbmouse did.

<P>If the wacom driver did not get control, and instead you see
"Tablet XD-1212-U" or similar in its place, then this section is for
you.  Otherwise, consider yourself lucky and skip on to the next section,
<A HREF="#viewdata">Viewing the Raw Data</A>.  For the unlucky,
there is a good possibility that your kernel is slightly out of date and
that your usbmouse.c and hid-core.c files need some help.

<P>When the Tablet XD-1212-U driver comes up, either usbmouse.o or hid.o
has discovered your tablet, decided it was an HID device, and grabbed it.
This is bad news because HID tablets seem to only output relative
coordinates and nothing about pressure.  You are in good company though
because a number of people have reported this, even on some fairly
up-to-date distributions.  Now let's fix it.


<A NAME="buildhid">
<H3>3.6.3 - Building usbmouse.o and hid.o</H3>

<P>In the <A HREF="/wacom/wacpack-0.2.0.tar.gz">wacpack-0.2.0.tar.gz</A> file, you will find the 2.4.19 versions
of usbmouse.c and hid-core.c files which have special exceptions for wacom.
These files are not built by default, so you will need to reconfigure the
package and run make again.

<DIV CLASS=diff>
At least one person has reported errors building these files on Debian Woody
running kernel version 2.4.20.  This is not surprising since the
source code came from 2.4.19, but I will do what I can to get these drivers updated in the near future.

<P> First off, if the code does not build, and you cannot chase the problem
down yourself, send me a line.  If your kernel is much older than 2.4.18,
then you may have to resign yourself to the fact that the 2.4.19 drivers
are not going to work for you.  I would recommend upgrading your kernel.  Some
people are already running kernel version 2.4.20 and have encountered 
problems building as well.  I will update these drivers to 2.4.20 as soon as possible.

<P>Rather than copy these files to the kernel modules directory right
away, it would be wise to test whether they get the job done. We should also
verify that they load properly.

As for unloading the old drivers, none of them should be busy, but if you

<P>If everything is working correctly, the log should look similar to the
lines above.  I removed some of the extraneous information, so if you have
more than this, you should be fine.  The most important thing here is that
the usb_mouse_probe detected and ignored the wacom.  It actually gets
several shots at it, but I removed the redundant lines.  For the final test,
unplug and replug the tablet.  Now check the log.  The wacom driver should
be calling the shots from here on out.

<P>If all is well, and you are installing modules rather than <i>insmod</i>'ing
them as you go, then now is the time to copy the usbmouse.o and hid.o
drivers to their proper places in the kernel modules directory.
<SPAN CLASS=diff>As before with some other distributions, if the files in the

If you get this message, but with a different quirk, or if the wacom driver
still is not getting control by this point, there is a possibility that your
tablet is not listed in any of the driver files.  If so, continue on to the
next section.  Otherwise, if you are up and running, skip to
<A HREF="#viewdata">Viewing the Raw Data</A>.
<A NAME="newtablet">
<H3>3.6.5 - Unknown Tablet?</H3>
To determine whether your device is listed in the driver, we need to determine
the device identifier.  It can be discovered by doing the following:

<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
[root@ayukawa root]# grep -i 56a /var/log/messages | tail -10

</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>In this case, the tablet identifier is 56a/44 (also written 0x56a/0x44).
The model is determined by the second number; the Intuos2 12x12 is 0x44 for
instance.

<P>In the wacom.c file, you will find a table called "wacom_ids." Look for
your device identifier.  Only the identifiers listed are handled by the
wacom driver, so if it is missing, it needs to be added.  Also look in
hid-core.c.  It has a table called "hid_blacklist" which identifies devices
to ignore.  The code is a little strange, but PENPARTNER is 0x00, GRAPHIRE is
0x10, INTUOS is 0x20, PL is 0x30, and INTUOS2 is 0x40.  A table entry like
INTUOS2 + 4 would therefore be 0x44.

<P>If you've gotten this far, and still cannot get it to work, send me email
with your device identifier and as much of an explanation of where things did
and did not work as described.  I'll see what I can do about at least finding
out why it did not work.  Then we can go on to solutions.

First off, you have to move the mouse or tap the pen to get any output.
Second, you might not get anything at all.  Don't panic.  This
seems to happen occasionally. Unfortunately, the work-around is neither
straightfoward nor foolproof.  I am currently talking with Wacom developers
about this and hopefully we'll get it solved soon.

<P>Apparently, the device driver and the tablet occassionally get out of
sync with the tablet thinking it's still in HID mode when in fact it
should be in "mode 2."  By unloading and reloading the driver manually,
the initialization code has another opportunity to get it right.  Try the
<I>xxd /dev/input/event0</I> again.  This time, it <I>should</I> work.  If
not, send me some email.  I am trying to create a repeatable test case
for the Wacom developers, and your problem may be just what we need to
get this bug fixed.

<P>Incidentally, if you have a program running that is connected to
/dev/input/event0 (like X or wacdump for instance), it is possible that
the tablet will not reattach back to the same event.  I have seen the
wacom reattach to /dev/input/event1 when unloading and reloading the
wacom driver with wacdump running for instance.

<P>You should also try running <i>xxd</i> on /dev/input/mouse0.
You should get streams of data when the mouse and pen are moved
around the surface of the tablet.  It is this device that X will
look at for mouse movement.  Use Ctrl-C to exit xxd.
<A NAME="wacdump">
<H1>4.0 - wacdump</H1>
<P>wacdump.c parses and displays the raw event output.  You must
be root to run it unless you've set the permissions on /dev/input/event0
such that you can read it.  This program can run simultaneously with X,
but it's best if X has not be configured for the tablet yet.
wacdump is enabled by default in the configure script, so it should be
built automatically when you run <I>make</I>.

<P>The command line usage of wacdump (wacpack-0.2.0) is pretty simple:

<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
Usage: wacdump [-d device]
  -?, -h, --help       - usage
  -d, --device device  - use specified device
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>If you know that the tablet is attached to a device other than
/dev/input/event0, you can override it with the -d option, but otherwise,
the default is correct.  If you connect the /dev/input/event0 and get an
end-of-file error, then the wacom is probably attached to a different event.

<P>When you run wacdump, nothing will happen until you place a mouse or
pen near the surface.  After that, the screen will clear and you will see
a screen similar to the following output:

<P>This output comes from version 0.3.2 of the wacdump program.

<P>The next block shows events as they arrive.  Only the
event types that the device claims to generate are displayed.
The quickly changing numbers are timestamps.

<P>The middle block shows absolute positions of various device parameters.
It also shows the ranges that the device claims to provide.  If your device
exceeds these ranges, please let me know so I can fix the
driver.  All the available positions are displayed, even though some of
them are not available for certain pointers.  Different tablets will have
different capabilities; these are capabilities registered specifically for
your tablet by the wacom.o kernel driver.

<P>The second WHEEL value is from the relative events channel.  Presently,
only the beta drivers report relative events.

<P>The serial number of the current stylus is displayed next.  When two
pointers are present, the serial number will alternate.  This is especially
true of Intuos2 models and possibly less accurate of other models.

<P>Lastly, the button positions are displayed.  Some mice have more buttons
than others; the ones displayed are the ones that the tablet offers.   Buttons
like "Pen" or "Airbrush" are displayed as "Down" when the tool is in proximity
to the surface.

<P>Whenever you are curious if the device is working properly, wacdump is
a useful tool for determine exactly what is coming from the tablet.  You can
run it in conjunction with X or without.  The display is constrained to 80x25
so it can also be used on the main console terminal.

Two steps must be completed to get X to recognize the Wacom.  First,
you need to add some lines to XF86Config to inform X of the tablet's
existence.  Second, you need to update the XInput driver that pertains
to the Wacom since the one that ships with XFree86 is not very functional.
Neither driver holds a candle to the windows driver though, so you'll
have to take what you get for the time being.  Updates to the XFree86 driver
are available in the stable and beta releases on the

<A NAME="inputdev">
<H2>5.1 - Adding the InputDevices</H2>
<P>The X Window system identifies the stylus and eraser on your tablet as

your stylus can request that information directly, and this generally
bypasses whatever the mouse happens to be doing at the time.  This design
is not without problems though.  For one, changing your setup or adding
a new tool requires making changes to the XF86Config file and restarting
X.  This should be fixed in the future.

<P>For now however, add the InputDevice sections to your XF86Config file.  This

<P>The first three sections identify the cursor, stylus, and eraser devices
to XInput.  Notice that all three reference /dev/input/event0.  Additionally,
the TiltInvert option has been commented out.  You may want to experiment
with these values.

<P>The fourth InputDevice section is for the new beta driver.  Unless you
are actually testing this code, I do not recommend using this section, at
least not at present.  There is no harm in leaving it in the file, commented
in or out, just so long as it is not used in the ServerLayout section
described later.

<P><B>The threshold value is very important.</B>  Various wacom tablets behave
differently in terms of how the "TOUCH" event is detected.  On some tablets,
the device itself makes the determination, and on others, the driver detects
the event by examining the pressure value.  To make matters more complex,
the ranges are all different so what is good for my Intous2 may not be good
for your Graphire.  I am providing a default value of 10.  If the pressure
exceeds that value, a "TOUCH" event is sent to the XInput system.  If this
is too hard, you may want to reduce it.  If the value is too low, you will
encounter the reviled "spurious touch" problem where the stylus clicks
randomly as you move it around the screen.

<P>Also, people using serial tablets will need completely different settings.
Please see <A HREF="http://people.mandrakesoft.com/~flepied/projects/wacom/">Lepied's Wacom Site</A> for
more details.

<P>I am including a copy of the man page for the driver.  Some of the fields
pertain only to the serial device, and some of the fields may be deprecated
under XFree86 4.2.0.  Try them out, see what happens.</P>

NAME
       wacom - Wacom input driver

SYNOPSIS
       Section "InputDevice"
         Identifier "idevname"
         Driver "wacom"
         Option "Device"   "devpath"
         ...
       EndSection

DESCRIPTION
       wacom is an XFree86 input driver for Wacom devices.

       The  wacom  driver functions as a pointer input device, and may be used
       as the X server's core pointer.

SUPPORTED HARDWARE
       This driver supports the Wacom IV and Wacom V  protocols.   Preliminary
       support is available for USB devices on some Linux platforms.

CONFIGURATION DETAILS
       Please  refer  to  XF86Config(5x) for general configuration details and
       for options that can be used with all input drivers.  This section only
       covers configuration details specific to this driver.

       Multiple  instances  of the Wacom devices can cohabit. It can be useful
       to define multiple devices with different  active  zones.  Each  device
       supports the following entries:

               Option "Type" "stylus"|"eraser"|"cursor"
                   sets  the type of tool the device represent. This option is
                   mandatory.

               Option "Device" "path"
                   sets the path to the special file which  represents  serial
                   line  where  the tablet is plugged.  You have to specify it
                   for each subsection with the same value if you want to have
                   multiple  devices  with  the  same  tablet.  This option is
                   mandatory.

               Option "USB" "on"
                   tells the driver to dialog with the  tablet  the  USB  way.
                   This option is only available on some Linux platforms.

               Option "DeviceName" "name"
                   sets the name of the X device.

               Option "Suppress" "Inumber"
                   sets  the  position  increment  under which not to transmit
                   coordinates.  This entry must  be  specified  only  in  the
                   first Wacom subsection if you have multiple devices for one
                   tablet. If you don’t specify this entry, the default  value
                   is computed to

               Option "Mode" "Relative"|"Absolute"
                   sets the mode of the device.

               Option "Tilt" "on"
                   enables tilt report if your tablet supports it (ROM version
                   1.4 and above).  If this is enabled,  multiple  devices  at
                   the same time will not be reported.

               Option "HistorySize" "number"
                   sets the motion history size. By default the value is zero.

               Option "AlwaysCore" "on"
                   enables the sharing of the core pointer. When this  feature
                   is  enabled,  the  device  will  take  control  of the core
                   pointer (and thus will emit core events) and  at  the  same
                   time  will  be  able,  when  asked  so,  to report extended
                   events.  You can use the last available integer feedback to
                   control  this  feature.  When  the value of the feedback is
                   zero, the feature is disabled. The feature is  enabled  for
                   any other value.

               Option "TopX" "number"
                   X coordinate of the top corner of the active zone.

               Option "TopY" "number"
                   Y coordinate of the top corner of the active zone.

               Option "BottomX" "Inumber"
                   X coordinate of the bottom corner of the active zone.

               Option "BottomY" "number"
                   Y coordinate of the bottom corner of the active zone.

               Option "KeepShape" "on"
                   When  this  option  is  enabled,  the  active  zone  begins
                   according to TopX and TopY.  The bottom corner is  adjusted
                   to  keep the ratio width/height of the active zone the same
                   as the screen while maximizing the area described by  TopX,
                   TopY, BottomX, BottomY.


               Option "DebugLevel" number
                   sets the level of debugging info reported.

               Option "BaudRate" "38400", "19200" or "9600" (default)
                   changes  the  serial link speed. This option is only avail‐
                   able for wacom V models (Intuos).

               Option "Serial" "number"
                   sets the serial number associated with the physical device.
                   This allows to have multiple devices of the same type (i.e.
                   multiple pens). This option is only available  on  wacom  V
                   devices  (Intuos).  To see which serial number belongs to a
                   device, you have to set the DebugLevel to 6 and  watch  the
                   output of the X server.

               Option "Threshold" "number"
                   sets  the  pressure  threshold  used to generate a button 1
                   events of stylus devices for some models of tablets (Intuos
                   and Graphire).

<A NAME="mouse1">
<H2>5.2 - Mouse1</H2>
<P>Adding the Mouse1 device is <I>probably not something you want to do</I>,
and Redhat's Anaconda program will do it for you if you boot the machine with
the tablet plugged in.  You'll need to be careful about this.

<P>When you use the mouse1 input device, the data flows from the wacom
kernel driver, through the event subsystem, down into the mousedev driver,
out the /dev/input/mouse0 device, and finally into the XInput mouse driver.
You effectively lose all your absolute positioning information because the
mousedev driver converts it into relative data.  Additionally, the XFree86
wacom driver does not get control of the cursor because mouse1 is providing
those events.

<P>Therefore, if you have a Mouse1 section, leave it.  Redhat 8.0 at least,
expects it to be there; however, you will not be using it, so make certain
that it is commented out of the section covered next.
<A NAME="srvlayout">

<P>This section determines which devices are actually used by the server.  In
the case above, the cursor, stylus, and eraser devices are selected while
the mouse1 and tablet devices are commented out.  At present, this is the
correct configuration for proper operation of the tablet whether you are
using the beta package or the production package.

<P>The new wacom_drv.o driver contains two independent implementations of the
tablet code.  Using the "tablet" device instead of the cursor/stylus/eraser
devices will enable that code.  Presently, that will do little for you since
the code is fairly volatile and is simply a testbed for various design ideas.
As it becomes more useful, I will update this section.

<P>You have completed the XF86Config file changes.  By aware that if you reboot
your computer with the Wacom plugged in and Redhat's Anaconda program notices,
it will treat the tablet as a USB mouse and reconfigure this file incorrectly.
You may need to go back and check the file to ensure that everything is
still correct afterwards.  Rebooting with the device detached seems to
reverse the process, but again, you should check the file to be certain.
My recommendation is to tell Anaconda to ignore the tablet until the device
detection works properly.
<A NAME="wacomdrv">
<H2>5.4 - Updating wacom_drv.o</H2>
<P>There are a number of wacom_drv.o files about.  XFree86 is shipping
version 23.  Redhat 8.0 is shipping version 25.  Lepied's page has the
source code for 26, but the binary identifies itself as 23ss1.  The
<A HREF="#download">Downloading the Code</A> page currently
offers source and binary for 26-j0.2.0 in the stable package
and 26-j0.3.2a in the beta version.  In total, I recommend
using the drivers in the packages that I provide since they correspond with
what is shown in this document.  Any new functionality that gets added will
be built on top of these files as well.

<P>Note: the binary wacom_drv.o file is located in the prebuilt directory
of the stable and beta packages.  Building this file from source (which is
provided) is a major hassle, and I do not recommend it unless you are
developer yourself or the binary is simply not compatible with your system.
Instructions for rebuilding from source are available in the Appendix
under <A HREF="#builddrv">Building wacom_drv.o From Scratch</A>.

<P>With that said, locate and replace wacom_drv.o.  Using <i>locate</i> again, we find
the driver in the X11 tree.  This directory is pretty standard, so it is
unlikely that your file will be located elsewhere.  Note the assumption is
that you are using XFree86 4.x.  Anything from the 3.x version probably won't
work.

Again, the old file is copied away, and replaced with the newer version.  The
binary modules are presently built on a Redhat 8.0 system using gcc 3.2 under
glibc.  This should work for most, if not all, major distributions.  If it
does not load on yours, please let me know.

If the X server dies, you can always back-out the changes to the XF86Config
file and try again.  Worse case, copy the wacom_drv_old.o file back to
its original place.  But first, look at the XFree86 log file for clues.
You might want to do this even if everything works correctly.  When things
are running right, the following lines appear in my log file.

Notice the driver version 26-j0.2.0 above.  This is the new stable
wacom_drv.o driver.  The beta driver is currently 26-j0.3.2a.

<P>First things first, you should lift the mouse off the tablet and place it
back down.  This seems to help reset things internally.  When you replace the
mouse, the cursor should jump to that portion of the screen.  If everything is
working correctly, the mouse should work in absolute mode with the four
corners of the tablet corresponding with the four corners of the screen.  If
the cursor stops short of an edge, then the kernel driver limits are probably
incorrect.  Please let me know so that I can update the driver.

<P>Next, remove the mouse and try using the eraser end of the stylus.
Hovering over the surface of the tablet should move the cursor.  Touching the
eraser tip to the surface should generate a click.  If you invert the
pen and use the stylus tip, you should get a similar result.  If the pen
tip generates spurious touch events, you will need to increase the threshold
value in the InputDevice section.  Wacdump is useful for determining the
appropriate value.  My pen pressure oscillates between 0 and 6 so I use
a threshold of 10 to compensate.
<A NAME="ptrstat">
<H2>5.6 - Check the Pointer Status</H2>
<P>You can check the XInput pointer status by using <i>xsetpointer</i>
as below.  The man page states that calling xsetpointer with the name of
a particular device will set it as the primary pointing device.  So far,
that has not been the case in my experience; however, that is the subject
of current development, so try it, and if it doesn't work, stay tuned.

<H2>9.1 - Building wacom_drv.o From Scratch</H2>
<H3>Introduction</H3>

<P>I should tell you out-right that this is an ugly, time consuming process.
If you manage to get this working in fewer steps, by all means, let me know.

<P>Why would you want to do this?  Two reasons.  One, you are a developer
and need to make changes to the source code directly.  Two, your distribution
uses c libraries or configuration options that are not compatible with the
wacom_drv.o file that I provide.  People running libc5 for instance, would
need to build their own driver.

<BLOCKQUOTE><DIV CLASS=diff>
Timothy Klein has submitted a brief howto for compiling on Debian Stable
which is still running XFree86 4.1 as of this writing.  It covers steps
one through four of this document, and a savvy developer should be able
to figure out step five on his own.  If someone solves step five and
generates a patch to Makefile.am, I'll see what I can do about getting
it into the configuration script.  That document is on the <A HREF="#debwcmdrv">Building wacom_drv.o On Debian Stable</A> page.
</DIV></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>You will need the X source code to rebuild the wacom_drv.o driver.
The build configuration for X generates a number of header files that are
necessary but not installed by default on most distributions.  Consequently,
you will need to not only get the source, but build it, practically in its
entirety.  Then, after all that, the configure script can be instructed to
hook into the X build tree and rebuild xf86Wacom.c at any time without
having to rebuild X again.

<P>Since I am running Redhat 8.0 and cannot really pull down the original
XFree86 4.2.0 source code, compile it, and expect it to work on my
system, I need to instead use the source RPM provided by Redhat.  If you
choose to go this route, I provide pretty detailed instructions for making
this work.  If your distribution works differently, or you are using Gentoo
where most everything is source code by default, you'll need to handle this
as best as possible according to your particular situation.

<P><H3>Step One: Get The Source</H3>

<P>On Redhat 8.0, I discovered the version number for my currently installed
XFree86 packages by running <I>rpm -q XFree86</I>.  This reported version
4.2.0-72, therefore the source package is XFree86-4.2.0-72.src.rpm.
I downloaded the package from Redhat directly and installed it to the system
as follows:

<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
[root@sen src]# rpm -ivh XFree86-4.2.0-72.src.rpm
   1:XFree86                ########################################### [100%]
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>This installs a number of files to the /usr/src/redhat directory,
particularly in the SOURCES and SPECS subdirectories.  Other distributions
undoubtedly install elsewhere.  Look for the XFree86.spec file which should
be located in the SPECS directory.  This file contains all the information
necessary to patch the orginal XFree86-4.2.0 source code to the level that
Redhat is distributing in their regular binary package.  The source code
and patch files are located in SOURCES.

<H3>Step Two: Build the Source</H3>

<P>This step describes how to build the source from the RPM itself.  If
you are building from some other mechanism, I honestly cannot offer much
assistance since I generally don't build my X system from scratch.
If you'd like to write up a short section on building the
server for your particular distribution, I would be happy to include it here.

<P>Next, you don't actually have to build the entire thing.  The
point at which the xf86Wacom.c driver can be built however,
is not until somewhere in the middle of the build process.  The driver
depends on a number of header files that are created dynamically so until
they are generated, wacom_drv.o cannot be compiled.  My solution
was to open a separate terminal in the wacom driver directory and
periodically attempt to build it.  When it successfully built, I stopped
the X build process.  Here's how to build the source for an RPM that's
been exploded out into the SPECS and SOURCES directories.

<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
[root@sen root]# cd /usr/src/redhat
[root@sen redhat]# rpmbuild -bc SPECS/XFree86.spec
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Not every distribution has <I>rpmbuild</I>; try using just <i>rpm</i>
instead.  At some point, Redhat split the build functionality into separate
programs.  If after looking through the <i>rpm</i> man page, you still
cannot get this to work, send me some email, and I'll look into it.

<P>The important item is the "-bc" option of <I>rpmbuild</I> which unpacks,
patches, and builds the source without actually installing.  While it is also
possible to simply unpack and patch using the "-bp" option, there does not
seem to be a way to just build.  The "-bc" option simply deletes all the
files provided by "-bp" and recreates them again.  The downside of this is
that if you wanted to simply unpack, patch, and then copy the new xf86Wacom.c
file over the old one, you'll find that the build step deletes it and starts
over again.  I have gotten this to work by creating a new patch file, but
this requires a bit more effort, so I don't recommend it right off.

<H3>Step Three: Build the Original Driver</H3>

<P>The xf86Wacom.c file is buried pretty deep in the X build tree.  If it
is in a different location than the one I have provided below, try using
<I>find . -name xf86Wacom.c</I> from the BUILD directory.

<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
[root@sen redhat]# cd BUILD/XFree86-4.2.0/xc/programs/Xserver/hw/xfree86/input/wacom
[root@sen wacom]# ls
Imakefile  wacom.man    xf86Wacom.c.Wacom-USB-driver-a25-update
Makefile   xf86Wacom.c
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>

The "a25-update" file is the original xf86Wacom.c file before Redhat's patch.
If you open xf86Wacom.c, you'll find that it is version 25, at least as
of this writing and this distribution.  The presence of the Makefile means
that the configuration has at least been run for this directory.  If you
have built a sufficient portion of the X source files, then all the header
files that you need have been generated, and you can build xf86Wacom.c.  Try
it, and if it does not build, wait a bit.  The absence of xf86Version.h
for instance, is a good indication that the build process is not ready.

<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
[root@sen wacom]# make
rm -f xf86Wacom.o
gcc -O2 -march=i386 ... -c xf86Wacom.c
rm -f wacom_drv.o
ld -r xf86Wacom.o -o wacom_drv.o
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>Step Four: Build the New Driver</H3>

<P>With a valid build environment, it should be possible to copy the
updated driver source over the old one, run <i>make</i>, and get an updated
driver.

<BLOCKQUOTE><DIV class=diff>The beta package contains a version xf86Wacom.c that depends
on wcm-beta.c and wcm-beta.h.  If you are compiling this version, you will
need to copy all three files.  Secondly, the driver will build and link, but
will not be usable since the current X build environment does not expect the
wcm-beta code to be compiled.  This problem is addressed correctly in the
automated build process discussed below.
</DIV></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
[root@sen wacom]# cp xf86Wacom.c xf86Wacom_old.c
[root@sen wacom]# cp /home/jej/src/wacom/src/xf86Wacom.c xf86Wacom.c
[root@sen wacom]# make
rm -f xf86Wacom.o
gcc -O2 -march=i386 ... -c xf86Wacom.c
rm -f wacom_drv.o
ld -r xf86Wacom.o -o wacom_drv.o
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>

If the source did not build correctly the second time, it is possible
that the Imake-based build environment has generated a makefile that
will not work correctly for the new code.  Your options are to generate
a patch file that can be applied by the build process, hack the makefile
in the driver directory to work properly, or to find some
way to get Imake to reconfigure.  This is probably less of a hassle for people
building from source, but to be fair, all the commands and information you
need to reconfigure from RPM are listed in the beginning of the build output.
You might also want to continue ahead to see if the default build rule does
not work for you.

<H3> Step Five: Automating the Build Process</H3>

<P>Copying the updated source file into the build tree and compiling from
there is not convenient.  By configuring the package with the --with-xf86
option set to the XFree86 build tree and enabling the driver using the
--enable-wacomdrv option, you can build the driver outside of the X build
tree.
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
[jej@ayukawa wacom]$ ./configure \
	--with-xf86=/usr/src/redhat/BUILD/XFree86-4.2.0 \
	--enable-wacomdrv
...
BUILD ENVIRONMENT:
            XFree86 - yes
  BUILD OPTIONS:
        wacom_drv.o - yes
[jej@ayukawa wacom]$ make
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The makefile rule which builds the driver is contained within src/Makefile.am
and is modified according to the configuration to generate a rule similar to
this in src/Makefile:

<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
xf86Wacom.o: xf86Wacom.c
        gcc -O2 -march=i386 -mcpu=$(ARCHITECTURE) -pipe -ansi \
                -pedantic -Wall -Wpointer-arith -fno-merge-constants \
                -I. -I$(XF86_DIR)/programs/Xserver/hw/xfree86/common \
                -I$(XF86_DIR)/programs/Xserver/hw/xfree86/loader \
                -I$(XF86_DIR)/programs/Xserver/hw/xfree86/os-support \

                -o xf86Wacom.o -c xf86Wacom.c
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><DIV class=diff>In the beta package, a similar rule applies to wcm-beta.c.
</DIV></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The options and directories specified come directly from the output of the
make command in the previous step.  All the root and parent directories have
been replaced with the macro XF86_DIR which in this case is set by the
configuration script to /usr/src/redhat/BUILD/XFree86-4.2.0/xc.  If the
options that you see in your build are identical to those above, then the
default rule will work for you now.  If not, you'll need to make some
alterations.  You can update the Makefile.am file and rerun automake,
update the Makefile.in and rerun configure, or just update the Makefile
directly.  

<P>So long as the X build tree exists, the include directories will point to
the correct locations, and the driver will build.  If space is an issue, you
can probably remove all the non-essential directories, but be careful; the
dependency tree in X is huge.

<H3>Conclusion</H3>

<P>Although a bit of a hassle, it is possible to compile the xf86Wacom.c
file into the wacom_drv.o driver from outside the X build tree.  If you
have any comments, questions, or suggestions regarding this process,
please send email to <A HREF="mailto:jej@j-arkadia.com?SUBJECT=WACOM_DRV">jej@j-arkadia.com</A> with a subject of "WACOM_DRV".

<PRE>
Just thought I would give you some brief notes on compiling wacom_drv.o
on Debian Stable. This must be done, as the Stable version of Debian
has XFree86 v. 4.1.0.1, and your pre-compiled module is for a later
version of X (4.2?). X complains about the server having ABI 2, and the
module having ABI 3, and refuses to load. So one must compile the
wacom_drv.o module for Debian Stable.

The good news is that, while it requires a *huge* download, and takes a
bit of time, it is easy.

-------------------------------------------------------------
Debian wacom_drv.o Compilation

<B>1. Download the Debian source package for XFree86.</B>

For Debian Stable this is three files:

xfree86_4.1.0-16.diff.gz
xfree86_4.1.0-16.dsc
xfree86_4.1.0.orig.tar.gz

Note that these are *big* files. The 'diff' file is 1.5 megabytes, and
the 'orig' file is 52 megabytes. So if you have a 28.8 modem
connection, this is going to be painful.

These files can be obtained automatically by using the command:

apt-get source xfree86

It is not necessary to be root to download the source package. After it
is downloaded, the package will be automatically extracted. Using this
method requires that you have a valid 'source' line in your
'/etc/apt/sources.list' file, though.

You can also just download the three packages above from your favorite
Debian mirror. If you do that, you need to extract them yourself, which
is done with the following command:

dpkg-source -x xfree86_4.1.0-16.dsc &lt;only for manual download&gt;

Either method will give you a 'xfree86-4.1.0' directory in the download
directory. For both this step, and the later package creation, you are
going to need tools from the 'dpkg-dev' package. So install that with
'apt-get' if you don't already have it installed.



<B>2. Make sure you have the requisite build dependencies.</B>

XFree86 requires certain packages to compile. It seems that 'dpkg' is
pretty good about telling you what packages it needs if they are not
installed (probably a nice script included by the Debian X maintainer).
Thus, you can just try and compile it and see what it complains about
not having and, at that point, install the needed packages with apt-get.
The other, cleaner, option is to run:

apt-get build-dep xfree86

This command will attempt to automatically install (or once in a blue
moon uninstall) all the necessary packages to compile XFree86. You need
to be 'root' to do this.


<B>3. Begin the Build Process for xfree86</B>


Become 'root' (or you could use fakeroot), and change into the
'xfree86-4.1.0' directory. Then run:

dpkg-buildpackage

The source will begin to compile. It will take a while. If you have a
really old machine, like a Pentium 166 or such, go on a vacation. It
may be done when you return.


<B>4. Recompile the wacom_drv.o module.</B>

The source you need to replace and recompile will be in the following
directory:

&lt;download_dir&gt;/xfree86-4.1.0/build-tree/xc/programs/Xserver/hw/xfree86/input/wacom

Replace the 'xf86Wacom.c' file therein with the one provided. While X
does need to have some configuration done for this to compile, and that
configuration is accomplished automatically by the build process, it
does not necessarily need to finish compiling the whole package. So,
once a 'Makefile' is created automatically by the build scripts in this
directory, you can attempt to run 'make' from time to time. Once it
compiles without error, you can halt the very lengthy build process of
the XFree86 package.
</PRE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><DIV CLASS=diff>This may not work with the current beta package
since it also contains the wcm-beta.c and wcm-beta.h files.  You can
solve this by updating the Makefile, or proceed to step five
on the <A HREF="#builddrv">Building wacom_drv.o From Scratch</A> page.
The command line options for building the driver will undoubtably have
changed, so be prepared to update the Makefile in the wacpack/src directory.
</DIV></BLOCKQUOTE>

<PRE>
<B>5. Move the wacom_drv.o module to the proper place.</B>

That's it. Once the 'make' command compiles without error, you will
have several new files in the directory. The one we are interested in
is 'wacom_drv.o.' Now you can just move the 'wacom_drv.o' file to the
directory:

/usr/X11R6/lib/modules/input/

This will also require 'root' privileges.
---------------------------------------------------------------------

You may want to add that to you HOWTO, for my fellow Debian users. And
thanks again for the very nice work on the HOWTO and the drivers.

HTH,

Tim
