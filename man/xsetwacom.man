.SH NAME
.LP
xsetwacom \- commandline utility to query and modify __drivername__ driver settings.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.LP
xsetwacom [options] command [device_name] [parameter] [value]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.LP
This program queries or changes properties on the devices loaded by the
__drivername__ driver. The modification of properties happens at runtime
and is not persistent through X server restarts.
.SH "GENERAL OPTIONS"
.TP
\fB-d, --display\fR display_name
Connect to the X server specified in display_name; see X(__miscmansuffix__).
.TP
\fB-h, --help\fR
Prints a short help.
.TP
\fB-v, --verbose\fR
Enable verbose output, useful for debugging.
.TP
\fB-V, --version\fR
Display version number and exit.

.SH "COMMANDS"
.LP
Allowed commands are
.B list,
.B get,
and
.B set.
The command may be specified with our without one or two preceding
dashes, i.e.
.B --list
is equivalent to
.B -list
and
.B list.

.SS "LIST COMMANDS"
.TP
\fBlist\fR devices
List known devices. Only input devices managed by the __drivername__
driver are listed.
.TP
\fBlist\fR parameters
List known parameters. List all parameters suitable for the
.B get
or the
.B set
command. Note that not all parameters are available on all device types.
.TP
\fBlist\fR modifiers
List the available list of modifiers to be used when setting key or button
actions.

.SS "GET COMMANDS"
.TP
\fBget\fR device_name parameter
Get the current settings for the parameter on the given device. Note that
not all parameters are available on all device types. The special parameter
name "all" may be provided to display all current settings on the device.
.TP
By default, options are printed on the commandline in the respective format.
The output format may be altered with one of the following options:
.TP
\fB-s, --shell\fR
Display the output in shell format, i.e. as shell commands to xsetwacom to
reproduce the same parameter.
.TP
\fB-x, --xconf\fR
Display the output in xorg.conf format, i.e. as option lines that may be
added to the InputDevice section in the xorg.conf.

.SS "SET COMMANDS"
.TP
\fBset\fR device_name parameter value
Set the parameter value on the given device to the value provided. Note that
not all parameters are writable, some are read-only and result in an error
when trying to be modified.

.SH "PARAMETERS"
.LP
Not all parameters are available on all tools.  Use the get command with the
parameter or "all" parameter for specific input tool applicable parameters
and current settings.
.TP
\fBArea\fR x1 y1 x2 y2
Set the tablet input area in device coordinates in the form top left
x/y and bottom right x/y. Top left and bottom right are defined in the
device's native orientation, regardless of the actual rotation currently
applied. Input outside of these coordinates will be clipped to the edges
of the area defined.  Default:  0 0 x2 y2; with x2 and y2 tablet specific.
.TP
\fBButton\fR button-number [mapping]
Set a mapping for the specified button-number. Mappings take the form of
either a single numeric button or an 'action' to be performed. If no mapping
is provided, the default mapping is restored.

Numeric button mappings indicate what X11 button number the given button-number
should correspond to. For example, a mapping of "3" means a press of the given
button-number will produce as a press of X11 button 3 (i.e. right click).

Action mappings allow button presses to perform many events. They take the form
of a string of keywords and arguments. For example, "key +a +shift b -shift -a"
converts the button into a series of keystrokes, in this example "press a, press
shift, press and release b, release shift, release a". In addition to the "key"
keyword, "button" and "modetoggle" are also recognized. Multiple keywords may
be present in one action if desired: for example "key +ctrl button 5 key -ctrl".
.TP
\fBMapToOutput\fR output
Map the tablet's input area to the given output (e.g. "VGA1"). The output
must specify one of those available through the XRandR extension. A list of
outputs may be obtained with the xrandr tool. The output mapping
configuration is a onetime setting and does not track output
reconfigurations; the command needs to be re-run whenever the output
configuration changes. When used with tablet rotation, the tablet must be
rotated before it is mapped to the new screen.
This parameter is write-only and cannot be queried.
.TP
\fBMode\fR Absolute|Relative
Set the device mode as either Relative or Absolute. Relative means pointer
tracking for the device will function like a mouse, whereas Absolute means
the pointer corresponds to the device's actual position on the tablet or
tablet PC screen.  Default:  Absolute for stylus, eraser and tablet PC touch;
Relative for cursor and tablet touch.
.TP
\fBPressureCurve\fR x1 y1 x2 y2
A Bezier curve of third order, composed of two anchor points (0,0 and 100,100)
and two user modifiable control points that define the curve's shape.  Raise
the curve (x1<y1 x2<y2) to "soften" the feel and lower the curve (x1>y1 x2>y2)
for a "firmer" feel.  Sigmoid shaped curves are permitted (x1>y1 x2<y2 or
x1<y1 x2>y2).  Default:  0 0 100 100, a linear curve; range of 0 to 100 for
all four values.
.TP
\fBRawSample\fR level
Set the sample window size (a sliding average sampling window) for incoming
input tool raw data points.  Default:  4, range of 1 to 20.
.TP
\fBRotate\fR none|half|cw|ccw
Set the tablet to the given rotation:
  none: the tablet is not rotated and uses its natural rotation
  half: the tablet is rotated by 180 degrees (upside-down)
  cw: the tablet is rotated 90 degrees clockwise
  ccw: the tablet is rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise

Rotation is a tablet-wide option: rotation of one tool affects all other tools
associated with the same tablet. When the tablet is physically rotated, rotate
any tool to the corresponding orientation.  Default:  none
.TP
\fBSuppress\fR level
Set the delta (difference) cutoff level for further processing of incoming
input tool coordinate values.  For example a X or Y coordinate event will be
sent only if the change between the current X or Y coordinate and the
previous one is greater than the Suppress value.  The same applies to
pressure level (Z coordinate) and Tilt rotation values.  With a current
absolute wheel (AbsWheel) or Tilt value the delta between it and the
previous value must be equal to or greater than the Suppress value in order
to be sent on.  Suppress is a tablet wide parameter.  A specified delta
level for one input tool is applied to all input tool coordinates.  To
disable suppression use a level of 0.  Default:  2, range of 0 to 100.
.TP
\fBTabletDebugLevel\fR level
Set the debug level for this tablet to the given level. This only affects
code paths that are shared between several tools on the same physical
tablet. A higher level means more fine-grained debug messages, a level of 0
turns debugging off for this tool. Requires the driver to be built with
debugging enabled. See also ToolDebugLevel.  Default:  0, range of 0 to 12.
.TP
\fBTabletPCButton\fR on|off
If on, the stylus must be in contact with the screen for a stylus side button
to work.  If off, stylus buttons will work once the stylus is in proximity
of the tablet (regardless of whether it is touching the screen).  Default:  on
for Tablet PCs; off for all other models.
.TP
\fBCursorProximity\fR distance
sets the max distance from tablet to stop reporting movement for cursor in
relative mode. Default for Intuos series is 10, for Graphire series (including
Volitos) is 42. Only available for the cursor/puck device.
.TP
\fBThreshold\fR level
Set the minimum pressure necessary to generate a Button event for the stylus
tip, eraser, or touch.  The pressure levels of all tablets are normalized to
2048 levels irregardless of the actual hardware supported levels.  This
parameter is independent of the PressureCurve parameter.  Default:  27,
range of 0 to 2047.
.TP
\fBToolDebugLevel\fR level
Set the debug level for this tool to the given level. This only affects
code paths that are specific to a given tool. A higher level means more
fine-grained debug messages, a level of 0 turns debugging off for this
tool. Requires the driver to be built with debugging enabled. See also
TabletDebugLevel.  Default:  0, range of 0 to 12.
